                <p>
                    Do you ever see countries work together to build each other up? You have probably seen countries help each other, 
                    but never in a big scale. You will mostly see countries just minding their own buisness. But, what if we could give 
                    them each other attentions? Could it make a difference in the world by world cooperation? Would it bring 
                    the world leaders and society closer? Let's say, that we start with something small, but something very 
                    effective. And with this, a little push, building world cooperation.

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p id="para-1">
                    The solution should not be difficult to accomplish, but it should be easy to access. We also know how greedy others can 
                    be, so it should be non-profitable. Our solution is to make a <em><strong>common world resource bank</strong></em>. 
                    This is where countries can put in recourses if they have a big surplus. And other contries that for example 
                    doesn't have alot of access those recourses, could be using that instad. If the country aren't willing to give alot of the 
                    recourses, maybe they can trade instead. What we are trying to say, is that we create a system where countries help 
                    each other by providing recourses, which will tempt other contries to join, and at the same time <em>increase world
                    trade</em>.

        <div class="thesolution">
                <p id="para-2">
                    The recourses can be anything from manual labour, money, technology or raw materials. This system will both help the developing 
                    countries and industrialized countries to grow even more. This will also bring the world together. What if a country 
                    was struck by a natural disaster? The countries connection through "<em><strong>the common world recourse bank</strong></em>" would
                    likely come to help out. And maybe the world was struck by a pandemic? Countries would both help each other and the 
                    countries that need the most help. We think that <em><strong>the common recourse world bank</strong></em> would lead to "support between
                    countries", "increase world trade" and "more/greater collaboration". This will inevitably lead to a better world.
